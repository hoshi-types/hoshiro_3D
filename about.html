<h3 class="h3-line">Digital Artist, Animator, 3D Artist and Modeler, Web Designer and Game Designer in-training.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p class="desc-baby">My name is Kenny Yu. I am currently learning how to be a game designer to create amazing video games working as one individual equal to the size of
    a AAA company. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Over the years, I have done many solo projects even during my younger school days. It was pretty tough, but I felt better knowing that I could focus and create something without
    any compromises from other people. I have a long history of performing my tasks alone and I was able to succeed doing it. 
    <br>
    <br>
    If I were to work for a business in being their web designer, I am confident that I can perform my tasks as needed and prefably in the comfort of my own home working remotely.
    I want to have a passion for creating video games, but I wouldn't let that distract me from doing web design work. Working with HTML and CSS may not neccessarily be my passion overall, but I am
    comfortable and I have fun doing it, because I've been doing it since high school. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I have also received 6 certificates in relation to Web Design on <a class="codecademy" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy.com</a>. I will not disclose it here due to privacy and I will only show it to employers.
    <br>
    <b>NOTE: I had to refresh my HTML and CSS by taking the programs and plus they were required anyway to receive the certificates.</b>
